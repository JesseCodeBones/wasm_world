# wasm world

## Motivation
wasm world aimed to be the light weight wasm interpreter compiler.  
we focus on wasm 1.0 now.  
we focus on JIT compiler, that means the compiler will not take too much loader time.
we also focus the scalable runtime API. the API will be coded during compilation,  
that will make runtime API is much more easier than dynamic link to the interpreter.
